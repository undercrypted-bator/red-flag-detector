Relationship Red Flag Detector 🚩
</h1>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-6">
Healthy relationships are built on trust, communication, respect, and emotional safety.
However, sometimes small behaviors can indicate deeper patterns that should not be ignored.
This tool is designed to help individuals reflect on relationship behaviors and identify
whether they may represent green flags, warning signs, or serious red flags.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Relationship Red Flags?</h2>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-4">
Red flags are behaviors that suggest unhealthy dynamics such as manipulation,
disrespect, emotional neglect, control, dishonesty, or even abuse. Identifying
these signs early can help protect your emotional well-being and support
healthier relationship decisions.
</p>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-6">
Not every concerning behavior means a relationship is doomed. Some issues arise
from stress, miscommunication, or personal growth challenges. That is why this
tool evaluates behaviors across multiple psychological categories before offering
a classification.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">How This Tool Works</h2>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-4">
The Relationship Red Flag Detector evaluates behaviors across multiple dimensions,
including emotional maturity, consistency, trust, respect, accountability, and
trajectory of change. Some behaviors are automatically classified as serious red
flags, particularly those involving physical harm or severe emotional abuse.
</p>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-4">
Other behaviors may fall into a yellow category if they represent warning signs
that require communication and boundary-setting rather than immediate termination
of the relationship.
</p>

<p class="text-zinc-300 mb-6">
If no concerning patterns are detected, the tool will indicate a green flag,
suggesting that the described behavior aligns with healthy relationship principles.
</p>
